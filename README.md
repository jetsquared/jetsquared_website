This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Personal Website

I had a lot of fun creating this website. This is my first reactjs application (albeit a static site - technically).

## Highlights

- Checkout the [Skills Component](https://github.com/jetsquared/jetsquared_website/tree/master/src/components/skills)
  - my data is a static json file
  - nested iteration to filter and map to my final output.
  - probably can be refactored to be more efficient?

## Credits

This project was built from a StartBootstrap template [Resume](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap).
